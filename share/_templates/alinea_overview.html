<b>Alinea</b> is a set of packages to simulate ecophysiological and agronomical processes (crop 3D development, light distribution, interactions with diseasesâ€¦). These packages have been developed during the alinea project, that joined different INRA teams and VPlants to set up a kernel collection of models adapted to this problematic.
